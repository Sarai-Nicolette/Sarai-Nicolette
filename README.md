# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Sarai Nicolette (she/her)

### Who am I? ðŸš€
I'm a Georgia Tech PhD graduate, fueled by a passion for deploying safe and secure autonomous vehicles (AVs) that uphold a healthy ecosystem of transportation options. My mission is to support thriving and eco-friendly communities through innovative technology.

### What I value? ðŸ’š
I'm deeply committed to advancing __Solarpunk__ idealsâ€”a philosophy centered around leveraging technology and design to prioritize planetary well-being and the welfare of humanity. Let's forge a future where sustainability is woven into the fabric of our everyday lives.

### What am I working on? ðŸŒŸ
My thesis work which demonstrates __the novel application of the Gaussian Process (a machine learning algorithm) for estimating the flight mobility performance for autonomous rotorcraft in real-time.__ 
PhD work can be very niche, but I am working on other projects to demonstrate the wide array of machine learning applications for improving the safety/self-awareness of AVs. Links to each project will be added here!
