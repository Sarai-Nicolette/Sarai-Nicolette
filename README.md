# Hi there! 👋 I'm Sarai Nicolette (she/her)

### Who am I? 🚀
I'm a PhD student at Georgia Tech, fueled by a passion for deploying safe and secure autonomous vehicles (AVs). My mission? To support thriving and eco-friendly communities through innovative technology.

### What I value? 💚
I'm deeply committed to advancing __Solarpunk__ ideals—a philosophy centered around leveraging technology and design to prioritize planetary well-being and the welfare of humanity. Let's forge a future where sustainability is woven into the fabric of our everyday lives.

### What am I working on? 🌟
I am completing my thesis work which demonstrates __the novel application of the Gaussian Process (a machine learning algorithm) for estimating the flight mobility performance for autonomous rotorcraft in real-time.__ 
PhD work can be very niche, but I am working on other projects to demonstrate the wide array of machine learning applications for improving the safety/self-awareness of AVs. Links to each project will be added here! 

### Fun Fact! 🐾
Ever seen a cat high-five or walk on a treadmill? That's my specialty! I love training my cat, Ravioli, to do adorable tricks. Check out his IG or TikTok page [@RaviolitheBoy](https://www.instagram.com/RaviolitheBoy) for some paw-some content!
